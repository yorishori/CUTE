# OpenGL Project
> Just a fun little project to learn the ins and outs of OpenGL using GLFW3

## Objective:
Write a simple game from scratch using the minimum required libraries. So far, the libraries used are:
- *GLEW*: A cross-platform open-source extension loading library. In short, it loads the OpenGL extensions (funtions, variales) into our project. (_Note that OpenGL is not a library, but a specificacion that hardware drives use_)
- *GLFW*: A cross-platform open-source API that handles the basics of windows, contexts, receiving input and OS events. Basically necesary for windows, since programs don't have low level access to the OS.
